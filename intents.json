Employees can apply for leave at least fifteen days in advance and can take leave up to three times in a calendar year. Leave can only be refused if it's necessary due to exceptional circumstances. Termination and Payment (Section 52(8) and 52(10)): If an employee's service is terminated o they quit before taking their entitled leave, they should be paid for the unused leave. The rate of payment is specified in section 53. This payment should be made shortly after termination or quitting, and there are different conditions based on whether the employee worked below or above ground. Notice Period (Section 52(9)): Unused leave should not be considered when calculating the notice period required for terminating an employee's contract. Death of Employee (Section 52(10)): If an employee dies while in service, their heirs are entitled to receive payment for any unused leave at the specified rate, subject to certain conditions depending on whether the employee worked below or above ground."

For core sector, sale of coal is guided by linkages and allocations by the competent authorities.For non-core Sector consumers, with a view to reaching the benefit of decontrol of coal as per Colliery Control Order, 2000, Coal India Limited has decided to authorize its subsidiary companies to formulate their own system and procedure for sale of coal to this sector. The new policy of Coal India Limited is aimed at providing a simplified, transparent and customer-friendly system and procedure. In the new policy framework the system of linkage and sponsorship for the purpose of coal supply to non-core sector is being done away with. In the emerging new policy framework for coal sale to non-core sector, stress is being given on bilateral agreement between supplying subsidiary company and consumer for well defined commitment on the part of both buyer and seller."
